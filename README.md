# Regression problem: computing the length of stay of patients in hospitals

In this project, we predict length of stay (in days) of a patient that is entering an ICU (Intensive Care Unit) using Decision Tree models and Ensemble methods.

The dataset comes from MIMIC project (***https://mimic.physionet.org/***) and can be directly found in this Kaggle link (***https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bgse-k-nn-death/data***). MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. Each row of ***mimic_train.csv*** correponds to one ICU stay (*'hadm_id'*+'*icustay_id'*) of one patient (*'subject_id'*). Column *'LOS'* S is the length of stay of this patient, equal to discharge time minus admit time. The remaining columns correspond to vitals of each patient (when entering the ICU), plus some general characteristics (age, gender, etc.), and their explanation can be found at ***mimic_patient_metadata.csv***. 

Note that the main cause/disease of patient condition is embedded as a code at *'ICD9_diagnosis'* column. The meaning of this code can be found at ***MIMIC_metadata_diagnose.csv***. However, this is only the main one; a patient can have co-occurrent diseases (comorbidities). These secondary codes can be found at ***extra_data/MIMIC_diagnoses.csv***.
